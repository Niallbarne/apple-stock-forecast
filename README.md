Dataset Description
The dataset used for forecasting is historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL), which includes daily closing prices. The data is obtained from a reliable financial data source and is formatted in a CSV file.

Model Overview
The forecasting model used in this project is the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. It is suitable for time series forecasting and considers the temporal dependencies in the stock price data. The model predicts future stock prices based on past observations.

Challenges Faced
Data Preprocessing: Ensuring that the date column is in the correct format and setting it as the index required careful handling.
Model Selection: Choosing the right parameters for the ARIMA model was challenging, and extensive testing was needed to achieve optimal results.
Visualization: Creating clear and informative plots to display historical prices and forecasted values, including confidence intervals.
